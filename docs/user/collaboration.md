## Attribute Comments, Bibliography & Certainty 

Attributes are the most molecular data inside the _Spacialist_ software. The users can set attributes "Uncertain" when the data source is not reliable and needs discussion and/or further research. This uncertainty can be discussed by using comments and/or bibliography references directly at the respective attribute.

## Metadata

You can add additional metadata to every entity, using the metadata tab. Here you can add a license, and a description of the entity.
Currently the creators and the editors are shown in the tab [2], in the future there should be the option to add furthor 'authors' 
to the entities, that did not actively work on said entity.
