Here you find the role you want to modify inside the roles list. With the icon in the &#39;Permissions&#39; column, you can edit the current permissions of the selected role. The permissions will be displayed in the <em>Permission Matrix</em> that looks similar to the image below. Just select the permissions inside the matrix to toggle said permission. You can toggle a whole row by clicking into the &#39;Select All&#39; column. Those changes will be updated for all users who have that role assigned.</p><figure><img src="'+m+'" alt="Image of the permission matrix of a role."><figcaption> Example of a set permission matrix for a &#39;guest&#39; user. </figcaption></figure><p>When designing your roles keep in mind, that you can apply multiple roles to a user. You can also add and remove those roles at any time. As a general rule of thumb, the participants should have as little permissions as possible but enough to not be hindered in their work. To make this more clear. E.g. if you are working with some research assistants, you don&#39;t want them to make changes to the data model. They shall be only allowed to add and modify <em>Entities</em>. So you could create a role &quot;Data Collector&quot; that is only allowed to add and edit entities.</p><h2 id="working-groups" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#working-groups"><span>Working Groups</span></a></h2>',20)),a("p",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("The ",-1)),e[2]||(e[2]=a("em",null,"Working Groups",-1)),e[3]||(e[3]=t(" are an extension on the premission system provided by the ",-1)),e[4]||(e[4]=a("a",{href:"../user/permission"},[a("em",null,"Role & Permission")],-1)),e[5]||(e[5]=t(" system.
