## Attribute Comments, Bibliography & Certainty 

Attributes are the most molecular data inside the _Spacialist_ software. The users can set attributes "Uncertain" when the data source is not reliable and needs discussion and/or further research. This uncertainty can be discussed by using comments and/or bibliography references directly at the respective attribute. If an attribute is marked as uncertain (!), has comments (ðŸ’¬) or has a bibliography reference (ðŸ”–) attached can be seen directly in the entity overview (A). Clicking on any of the symbols opens the window (B) where you can change the certainty, while optionally leaving a comment or add a quotation to the attribute, which is then seen inside the References Tab (see A).

## Metadata

You can add additional metadata to every entity, using the metadata tab. Here you can add a license, and a description of the entity.
Currently the creators and the editors are shown in the tab [2], in the future there should be the option to add furthor 'authors' 
to the entities, that did not actively work on said entity.
