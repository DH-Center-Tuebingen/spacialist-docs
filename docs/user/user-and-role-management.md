# User And Role Management

Spacialist supports a sophisticated user and role management system, that allows for a fine-grained access for users to prevent data-loss due to malicious activities.

## User

Every member of your team or additional external participants can be invited to access the project via an individual user account, as known from other online platforms. 


::: tip
Users can upload an avatar for easier recognition, and better collaboration in the software.

## Roles

Users by default do not have any user-permissions. Permissions are managed by roles, that bundle the permission into easy managable sets.

## Working Groups

The _Working Groups_ are an extension on the premission system provided by the [_Role & Permission_](../user/permission) system. 
This allows the creation of groups, users can be assigned to. Access to certain [Entities](../entity.md) can be managed for the whole
groups using this feature.
